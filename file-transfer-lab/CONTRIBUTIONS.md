In this lab I mostly modified Professor Freudenthal's code in the framed-echo
dir that is the framedClient.py, framedForkServer.py, framedServer.py, and
framedSock.py.
The following link was used to get an understanding of how to send file over
tcp:

and the following was used to look within current directory for specific
files:

The following was used to understand how encoding and decoding work:

The rest was simply manipulating Professor Freudenthal's code to achieve the
desired results.
